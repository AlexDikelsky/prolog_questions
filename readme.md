Implementation of the prolog questions in www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/ and Project Euler solutions.

Some implementations don't work exactly the same as the reference
implementation. The differences are usually small, such as `range.prolog`
not including the upper bound to a range as in Python.

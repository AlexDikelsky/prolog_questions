Implementation of some puzzles I have wanted to solve.

* The `ninety-nine-prolog-problems` are from www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/, and are all done in prolog.
Some implementations favor one-indexing and python-style range expressions
* Advent of Code 2021 is being done mostly in [BQN](https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN)

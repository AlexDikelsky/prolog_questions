Implementation of some puzzles I have wanted to solve.

1. The `ninety-nine-prolog-problems` are from www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/, and are all done in prolog.
Some implementations favor one-indexing and python-style range expressions
2. `advent_2020` is my solutions for the 2020 Advent of Code questions. They are in various languages including `python`, `awk`, and others.
